-- New Joinee onboarding: joiners awaiting asset allocation. Each joinee is
-- backed by a users row (status 'pending' until onboarded) so approved
-- allocations flow through the normal assets/accessories assignment paths.
-- The allocation agent drafts a laptop + headphone per designation rules;
-- an engineer reviews/edits, then approval finalizes via the existing
-- checkout/assignment writers (assignments, accessory_assignments, ledger).
